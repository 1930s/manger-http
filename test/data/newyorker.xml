						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">On Friday, about two hours before the sun came up over the village of Duma, in the West Bank, a man named Saad Dawabsheh tried to find his family in his burning house. He pulled out his wife, Reham, and their four-year-old son, Ahmed Sa’ed, was rescued, but he couldn’t see the eighteen-month-old, Ali, “due to the lack of electricity,” according to <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/beta/1.668871" target="_blank">a report in Haaretz</a>. It was too dark, and Ali was too small. He died in the fire. Reham and her surviving child are in the hospital—they have already been moved from one in Nablus to a specialized burn unit at the Sheba Medical Center, in Tel Hashomer, Israel—in critical condition.</p>]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">When U2 got together, in September, 1976, Bono, Adam Clayton, and the Edge were sixteen, and Larry Mullen, Jr., was fourteen. At first, they called themselves the Larry Mullen Band, then Feedback, then the Hype. They changed the band&#8217;s name to U2 the following year while playing at a community center in Howth, a gorgeous little seaside town near Dublin. When U2 released its first album, “Boy,” in 1980, half of its members were still teen-agers. Which is all to say that a lot has changed since then. The men are now in their fifties, and their band is almost forty years old. More than seven million people bought tickets to U2&#8217;s last tour, which began in 2009, ended in 2011, and involved a hundred-and-sixty-foot tall stage called “<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2212936/U2s-450-million-tour-Behind-groups-gigantic-360-degrees-concerts.html">The Claw</a>.” (It remains the highest grossing tour of all time.)

			<title>Movie of the Week: “The Future”</title>

						<description><![CDATA[ <p class="descender">There are titles that, by their very boldness, suggest the audacious scope of the movie that they name. “The Future,” the title of Miranda July’s second feature, from 2011 (which I discuss in this clip), is among them, and the movie lives up to its amplitude. July is a multimedia artist and “The Future” is a multimedia movie. The film gets one of its big plot twists from the Internet and the way that artists use it. July is a writer, and the movie’s dialogue is written with an exquisite lyrical whimsy that packs a lot of pain into simple yet unexpected phrases. July is also a conceptualist, and she builds a grand and even cosmic notion from a chance encounter—one that she then turned into a notable book, “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/miranda-julys-random-harvest">It Chooses You</a>,” in which she documents that process and its role in the film. She’s also an actress and a musician, and in portraying a dancer, she performs a dance, set to hauntingly well-curated music, that turns the film into a thrilling dramatic musical. It’s unsparing on the subject of a young—and perhaps no longer so young—artist’s ambitions. But, above all, the movie fulfills the literal idea of the title: it’s about time itself. For all its romantic, first-person intimacy, “The Future” is among the most cosmically visionary recent movies.</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p class="descender">There are titles that, by their very boldness, suggest the audacious scope of the movie that they name. “The Future,” the title of Miranda July’s second feature, from 2011 (which I discuss in this clip), is among them, and the movie lives up to its amplitude. July is a multimedia artist and “The Future” is a multimedia movie. The film gets one of its big plot twists from the Internet and the way that artists use it. July is a writer, and the movie’s dialogue is written with an exquisite lyrical whimsy that packs a lot of pain into simple yet unexpected phrases. July is also a conceptualist, and she builds a grand and even cosmic notion from a chance encounter—one that she then turned into a notable book, “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/miranda-julys-random-harvest">It Chooses You</a>,” in which she documents that process and its role in the film. She’s also an actress and a musician, and in portraying a dancer, she performs a dance, set to hauntingly well-curated music, that turns the film into a thrilling dramatic musical. It’s unsparing on the subject of a young—and perhaps no longer so young—artist’s ambitions. But, above all, the movie fulfills the literal idea of the title: it’s about time itself. For all its romantic, first-person intimacy, “The Future” is among the most cosmically visionary recent movies.</p><p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-the-future?mbid=rss">See the rest of the story at newyorker.com</a></p>Related:<br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/tom-cruise-the-good-kind-of-crazy">Tom Cruise: The Good Kind of Crazy</a><br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/buckley-vidal-and-the-queer-question">Buckley, Vidal, and the “Queer” Question</a><br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-the-patsy">Movie of the Week: “The Patsy”</a><br />]]></content:encoded>
